        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p class="word-wrap">Hi there! Welcome to my personal website. <br> 
            I'm Madeleine, and I'm a Data Scientist living in New York City. <br>
            I am currently working as Senior Investment Data Scientist in Vanguard's Investment Management Group, 
            on the Fintech Strategies team.
            <br> <br>
            I studied Fundamental and Applied Mathematics in the Classes Préparatoire aux Grandes Ecoles (CPGE) at Lycée Janson-de-Sailly in Paris, France. <br>
            I then studied Computer Science at Telecom ParisTech, a French engineering school, where I had a double concentration in 1. Computer Science Theory and Operations Research and 2. Data Science in Machine Learning. <br>
            I hold a Master's degree in Computer Science from Telecom ParisTech and a Master's degree in Data Science from Columbia University, for which I moved to the US in 2019.
            I have been working full-time as a Data Scientist since 2020.
            <br> <br>
            My areas of interest (work-related) include: (but are not limited to) <br>
            - Machine Learning, Deep Learning <br>
            - Natural Language Processing (old school <i>and</i> LLMs) <br>
            - Operations Research and Optimization (Linear Programming, Mixed Integer Programming) <br>
            - Graph Theory (and where it intersects with any of the above) <br> 
            - <b>Anomaly Detection</b> for Time Series, Graphs and how it can be applied to Cybersecurity, Fraud Detection, Investment Management... <br>
            - <b>Detection of AI-generated content</b> (Deep Fakes, LLM-generated text...), which is for me at the interesection of {most technically interesting} x {most impact on ethical use of AI for the general public}. <br>
